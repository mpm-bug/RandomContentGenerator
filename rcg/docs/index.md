# Random Content Generator Documentation

This project is intended to provide a library of useful functions for generating
random content for specific purposes.

As a first starting point, it'll provide functions for generating random numbers
within a specified range, with various approaches for specifying those ranges.
See [the random number generation design doc](./design/rng.md) for more details.
