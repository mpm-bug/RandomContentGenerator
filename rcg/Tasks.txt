List of tasks to do:

- Get the version number from the POM file and use that in Constants.java, instead of hardcoding it
  in Constants
- Implement the word generator registry, using the JSON format I've defined.
- Add a MANIFEST to the target JAR file, so that it runs com.salesforce.rcg.Demos
- Create a shaded jar file that pulls in all the dependencies?
- Create a shell script / Windows batch file that pulls in all the deps.

My notes on word list files (the JSON files under 'data'):
- JSON format is as good as anything, why
  not use that.

- The file should contain:
  - File description
  - Not sure what other file-level metadata
  - A list of one or more generator definitions

- Each generator definition contains:
  * Name
  * Weights - possible values are:
    - defined-weights (weights for each word)
    - unweighted
    ? Not sure if I'll ever need:
      - Zipf or other function-based weights
  - Enabled? Defaults to true, this gives a 
    way to include definitions in the file, but
    "comment them out", since JSON sux and doesn't
    contain comments.
  - wordlist or word-filename
    Source of the words. Must include one of these

  Starred elements are required
