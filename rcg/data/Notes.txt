My notes on word list files:
- JSON format is as good as anything, why
  not use that.

- The file should contain:
  - File description
  - Not sure what other file-level metadata
  - A list of one or more generator definitions

- Each generator definition contains:
  * Name
  * Weights - possible values are:
    - defined-weights (weights for each word)
    - unweighted
    ? Not sure if I'll ever need:
      - Zipf or other function-based weights
  - Enabled? Defaults to true, this gives a 
    way to include definitions in the file, but
    "comment them out", since JSON sux and doesn't
    contain comments.
  - wordlist or word-filename
    Source of the words. Must include one of these

  Starred elements are required
